    "If the data that you need to work with in a reseaech project is saved as a file on your computer, you can write a program to read this file and to make its contents available within the context of your code.\n",
    "\n",
    "In Python, files can be read using the `open()` function. The result of this function is a new object which is called a file handler (or, more specifically, a `TextIOWrapper` object). Simply put, a file handler is an object which establishes a connection to the text file on your disk. You are free to give this file handler object any name you like. \n",
    "\n",
    "When you use the `open()` function, you are also recommended to specify the character encoding scheme that has been used in the text file, using the `encoding` parameter. This will help Python to process all the characters correctly. \n",
    "\n",
    "Once the connection is established via the `open()` fuction, you can access the contents of the file in a variety of ways. A first option is to read the contents on a line-by-line or a paragraph-by-paragraph basis. This first approach can be followed when units such as lines or paragraphs in the text are delineated using the hard return or the newline character. If this is the case, the file handler that is created for the file, using `open()`, also becomes iterable: the `for` keyword can then be used to iterate across the various units represented by this file handler. \n",
    " \n",
    "The code below demonstrates how you can read and display the full contents of a text file, paragraph by paragraph. It assumes that there is a file named \"BraveNewWorld.txt\", saved in the same directory as the code. It also assumes that the various paragraphs are separated using a hard return. "

    "Context handlers are created using the `with` keyword. After `with`, yu need to use the `open()` function. This `open()` function needs to be followed by the words `as` and the name you would like to give to the file handler. In the code block underneath `with`, you can access the contents of this file handler. It is generally useful to assign the contents of the text file to a variable. When the code block underneath `with` ends, the file handler is closed automatically. This is actually a great advantage of a context handler.

    "The function `open()`, which can be used to read files, can also be invoked to create a new file.

The `open()` function used with the “w” parameter similarly creates a file handler.\n",

If you have one variable which records the base directory of a file, and a second variable which captures the filename, the `join()` function can concatenate the values of these two variables to create the full path to this file. The `join()` function always follows the conventions that are in place on a given operating system for representing paths. There can often be certain differences. While Mac OS uses forward slashes, for instance, Windows uses back slashes. Working with `join()` makes your code more platform-independent.        \n",
