Individual characters can be accessed by appending a set of square brackets to the name of the string variable, and by supplying the index of the character you want to access within these brackets. Using these indices, it becomes possible to extract specific characters from variables. When you use negative numbers (e.g. -1 or -2), Python starts selecting characters at the end of the string and moves back."
