    "## What these materials cover\n",
    "\n",
    "The tutorials that you can follow on this website explain the core features of the Python programming language, including topics such as variables, data types and control structures. Additionally, you can learn learn about the main techniques that can be used to clean, enrich, analyse and visualise data.\n",
    "\n",
    "These materials have been used in two courses:\n",
    "\n",
    "- Jupyter Notebook basics and sections 1 through 8 (sometimes 9) are used as part of our *Introduction to Programming with Python*;\n",
    "- Sections 10 through 12 are used in *Data Analysis with Python*.\n",
    "\n",
    "The [Centre for Digital Scholarship][cds] offers these courses several times per year for people affiliated with Universiteit Leiden.\n",
    "Course dates are announced in [Leiden University Libraries' event calendar][cal].\n",

    "The tutorial and supporting sections are written using Jupyter Notebook.\n",
    "In both courses, we ask learners to use the notebooks on their own computer.\n",
    "They follow the [Installation instructions](Installation.ipynb) and download the latest version of the notebooks, so that they can follow along with the instructors.\n",
