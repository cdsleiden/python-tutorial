This framework simlified the process of building a scraper/crawler considerably by providing basic functionalities out of the box. Although Scrapy does not understand what parts of webpages are of interest to you, it does many things for you, such as making sure you don't send too many requests at the same time or retrying requests that fail. Feel free to look at the [Scrapy tutorial](https://docs.scrapy.org/en/latest/intro/tutorial.html) if you want to experiment with this library. "
