    "So far, we have mostly focused on small pieces of code that perform specific tasks. In larger programs, the same types of tasks are often performed several times in different sections of the code. In such situations, it can be efficient to reuse particular pieces of code. Imagine, for example, that you want to write a program in Python which can calculate the final grades earned by students who have followed a certain course. Such grades are normally calculated using a fixed formula (e.g. a mid-term assignment which counts for 40% and a final exam which counts for 60%). To calculate the final grades, this formula needs to be applied repeatedly with different values. In such a situation, it would be quite inefficient if you simply repeated the code that is needed for every single student. Fortunately, we can reuse fragments of code by defining them as functions.\n",

    "* `len()` takes a string, list or dictionary and returns its length (i.e. the number of characters or items).\n",
    "* `float()` takes a numerical value (e.g. an integer) as input, and converts it into an integer. \n",
    "* `dict()` takes no inputs and returns an empty dictionary.\n",

Saving dates as `datetime` objects can be very helpful when you want to perform calculations on dates. For this exercise, calculate the number of days that have passed since January 1 2022. Follow the steps below. \n",
