    "Virtually all programming languages make use of variables of some sort. Variables can be thought of as containers or as boxes in which information can be stored temporarily. Variables always need to be given a name. This name can be used to retrieve the 'contents' of the variable. These contents (the data assigned to the variable) are referred to as the variable's *value*. \n",

    "Variables names can consist of any combination of alphanumerical characters that you can think of. Underscores are also allowed in variable names. Variable names cannot begin with a number, however, and they cannot contain a hyphen or spaces.\n",
    "\n",
    "Although it is possible to work with any sequence of characters, your script will evidently be most understandable when you make use of variable names which are meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are a number of reserved words which have a particular function in the Python language, and which cannot be used as variable names for this reason. The list of reserved words include ‘for’, ‘in’, ‘is’, ‘print’, ‘global’, ‘def’, ‘if, ‘elif’ and ‘else’. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, variables can be given a value. The act of giving a value to a certain variable is called *assignment*. In the first example, the variable named place_name is assigned the value ‘Leiden’. The second example captures a number."
