    "Image that you need to write a program in Python which can calculate the final grades earned by students who have followed a certain course. Such grades are normally calculated using a fixed formula (e.g. a mid-term assignment which counts for 40% and a final exam which counts for 60%). To calculate the final grades, this formula needs to be applied repeatedly with different values. In such a situation, it would be quite inefficient if you simply repeated the code that is needed for every single student. In most programming languages, fortunately, it is also possible to reuse fragments of code by defining these as functions.\n",
    "\n",
    "A function is essentially a set of statements which can be addressed collectively via a single name. Python has a number of in-built functions, such as `print()` or `len()`. As you have seen, such functions represent certain actions. To have these actions executed, you need to refer to the names of these functions in your programs. These function often take one or more parameters as input. These are values that need to be supplied to the function and that the fuinction will work with. \n",
    "\n",
    "The in-built function `round()`, for example, takes two parameters. You firstly need to provide a floating point number. Secondly, you need to specify how many digits you would like to see following the decimal point. "

    "Next to working with in-built functions, it is also possible to write your own functions. Working with functions can often be very effective. It enables you to decompose specific problem into smaller sub-problems and into units which can be reused as often as needed.

    "The first four lines of the code above define the function `calculateFinalMark()`. The `def` keyword needs to be followed by the name of the function, which you can specify yourself. The name of the function also needs to end in a set of parentheses. Within these parentheses, you can optionally mention the values the function should operate on. As was indicated above, the values mentioned within the parentheses are called the parameters of the function. If there are two or more parameters, these need to be separated by commas. In the example above, a certain calculation is carried out within the function, using the parameters that are supplied, and the result of this calculation is mentioned after the keyword `return`.\n",

    "Python is based on a programming paradigm which is known as object-oriented programming. This paradigm, in short, involves an organisation in which variables and functions which are closely related can be brought together in structure known as a class.  In the example below, the variables named `title` and `isbn`, and the function named `describe()` are brought together in a class named ‘Book’. \n",

For this newly created object, all the variables and all the functions which are defined in the class can also be accessed, by appending the names of the variables or functions to the dot following the object name. This notation is called the ‘period syntax’. Functions defined within classes are referred to as methods. A class thus functions as a blueprint or as a template for new types of objects."
