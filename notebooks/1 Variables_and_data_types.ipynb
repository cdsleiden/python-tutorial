Variables always need to be given a *name*. This name can be used to retrieve the 'contents' of the variable. These contents (the data assigned to the variable) are referred to as the variable's *value*. \n",

    "Although it is possible to work with any sequence of characters, your script will evidently be most understandable when you make use of variable names which are meaningful. \n",
    "\n",
    "Note that there are a number of reserved words which have a particular function in the Python language, and which cannot be used as variable names for this reason. The list of reserved words includes `for`, `in`, `is`, `global`, `def`, `if`, `elif` and `else`. \n",
    "\n",
    "As mentioned, variables can be given a value. The act of giving a value to a certain variable is called *assignment*. In the example below, the variable named `place_name` is assigned the value 'Leiden’. In this first example, the value of the variables consists of alphanumerical characters, surrounded by quotes. Such texts fragments are referred to as strings. The second variable, named `number_of_inhabitants` is used to capture a number."
