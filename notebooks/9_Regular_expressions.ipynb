    "Regular expressions can be used to search for specific patterns within texts. When you search using patterns, rather than search terms, you can generally search in much more advanced ways. You can search for words with specific types of characters or for words containing a specific number fo characters, for instance. \n",
    "\n",
    "Such regular expressions typically consist of a sequence of symbols which specify a search action. Once defined, such regular expressions can be matched against actual strings. \n",
    "\n",
    "Regular expressions can be constructed using literal characters and so-called metacharacters. The simple regular expression ‘flower’, for instance, only contains literal characters. It can be used to search for the six characters that are mentioned. Metacharacters, by contrast, are characters with a special meaning. They represent specific types of characters, such as characters in lower case, digits, spaces or tabs. When you combine literal characters and metacharacters, you can search for patterns rather than for literal strings or keywords.  \n",

    "## re.search()\n",

    "The standard installation of Python includes a useful module called `re`, which can be used to search for text fragments on the basis of regular expressions. To work with the module, you firstly need to import it. The module `re` contains a method named `search()`, which minimally requires two parameters. The first parameter is the pattern to search for, and the second parameter is the string in which you want to search. The method returns the value `True` if the pattern which is mentioned occurs in the string which is provided as the second parameter. \n",
    "\n",
    "The listing below offers an example. The regular expression, in this case, is simply a string consisting of literal characters.
