    "\n",
    "Data visualisations such as graphs and diagrams often make it easier for researchers to explore patterns and trends within large data sets, or to identify notable exceptions to the trends that can be observed. \n",
    "\n",
    "During the last number of years, a large number of visualisation libraries have been developed for the Python language. One of the most widely used libraries is `matplotlib`. This tutorial concentrates on three types of visualisations that you can create using matplot: bar charts, line charts and scatter plots. `Matplotlib` is very powerful, but its code can easily get quite complicated. The visualisation library named `seaborn` was built, more or less, as a shell around `matplotlib` and simplifies many of its aspects. This tutorial also explains a number of visualisations that can be created using `seaborn`.\n",

These have the column names 'A', 'B', 'C' and 'D'. There is also a column called 'class' containing a categorical variable. The column 'year', finally, contains years. "
