# Learning objectives

At the end of the section, learners should be able to...

## Section 4

- understand that code blocks are consecutive lines that have the same indentation,
  preceded by an unindented line that ends with a `:`
- use `if`, `elif` and `else` to conditionally execute statements
- understand the difference between `if` followed by `elif` and `if`-`if`
- understand that a `for` loop iterates over all items in a collection
- understand that the `range` function yields a range of numbers
- write a simple loop to print a series of parametrised statements
- understand that a `while` loop continues until the loop condition is false
- recognise when repeated statements could be converted to a loop statement

### Suggested exercises in ยง4

4.2 (and 4.3) for conditionals, 4.1 for loops

4.4 combines loops and conditionals, but provides too little guidance.

## Section 5

- understand that lists are containers for values that can contain duplicate values
- collect values in a list by adding on creation, appending and concatenation
- retrieve items in a list by their indices
- sort values in a list
- process items in a list by iterating over the values
- recognise that results of processing can be (temporarily) stored in lists
- check for the presence of a specific value in a list
- count occurrences of a value in a list
- combine loops and conditionals to filter items in a list

### Suggested exercises in ยง5

1. 5.1 (appending)
1. 5.5 (combines `for` and `if`), 
1. 5.2 (adds `in`), 
1. 5.6 (string split, counting, indexing)

Optional:

1. 5.3 (sorting, counting, indexing)
1. 5.4 is like 5.5, but requires string indexing


## Section 6

- understand that a dictionary stores combinations of keys and values
- create and fill a dictionary
- count the number of items in the dictionary
- retrieve values from a dictionary, including default (backup) values if the key does not exist
- process key-value pairs by iterating over the keys
- sort a dictionary by its keys
- understand that dictionaries are (most) often used to store various properties belonging to an item, similar to a form
- choose between collecting data in a list and a dictionary

### Suggested exercises in ยง6

1. 6.2 (requires string manipulation)
1. 6.3 (combines retrieving, iteration)
