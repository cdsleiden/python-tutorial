    "## Exiting Jupyter Notebook\n",

    "Since Jupyter Notebook is running in the background while you work in the browser frontend, closing the browser tabs or windows is not enough to stop the application. To exit Jupyter Notebook, click on the \"Quit\" button in the top right of the page showing the dashboard. When the background process succesfully terminated, Jupyter Notebook will tell you that you can close the browser tab or window."
